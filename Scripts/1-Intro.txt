Who I Am & What I Do

Hi Everyone, what amazing introductions from you all!
I want to thank the Open Source Committee and the Hack Day Organizers for the chance to do this presentation
They did a lot of work so that I didn't have to worry about anything but the presentation itself, and I just really appreciate that

As they said, I'm a gardener, an increasingly serious home cook, a member of the Los Angeles Tenants Union, and I work at the Academy's Oral History Projects department as their Sr. Archivist.
I came to coding kinda late in the game,
failed my ENG 101 class freshman year of college, where we solved problems like "here's an array of arrays that represents geological readings for a mountain range, using C++ find where is best to drill for oil"
Didn't code again for 6 years except in MAX/MSP/ Jitter for making noise music
doing my MSI, we had an intro to Python class with Dr. Chuck which was alright but I didn't think I'd use it much and the concept of "tuples" was like too much for my brain to handle

Cut to my first pro job and I needed to rename a hundred photos every week, doing that by hand wasn't fun but teaching a computer to do it was
And since then I've been trying to use code to make work easier for me at every available instance

So, I'm not a professional coder
There are very basic things about programming generally that are a mystery to me, probably forever (memory allocation?)
There are very basic things about my preferred programming language, Python, that are a mystery to me (wtf is self?) - I still have to google "python3 length of list" occasionally
I still use old-school workflows for coding like typing into a text editor and running code in a terminal window and printing info to said terminal window (wtf is pandas and jupyter lol)
I'm not doing anything groundbreaking in my work, from a technical perspective
I joke that my career is built on the principle of "checking a box in software A to make software B do something"
That's my specialty

But, there's still a lot of good that you can do while being bad at coding
And, you don't have to code at all in order to take advantage of Git and the ecosystem around it
So, I'm giving this presentation for the non-experts amongst us
And, I welcome input from any experts amongst us where I've misrepresented an idea, or if there's a "canonical" way of doing something that I missed

Agenda
Ok so there's two halves here with a break in the middle
the first half is devoted to discussing Git generally
The second half will have all of the How-To's
If you're here for How To's only,  you don't have to wait for us, they're available at the link in the chat
For the rest of us, I hope that by the time this is over you'll have an idea of what this buzzwordy thing is all about
And, maybe, how you can use it in Hack Day and beyond

2-0 background for the How To's

Ok everyone, for these tutorials there's a few things you gotta know
I'm exclusively using the command line for Git
I'm doing this for two reasons
1) it's how I use Git and what I'm familiar with
2) I want to make the command line less scary

Because, if you get into this kind of work, you will have to use the command line
It's not so bad

There are Git GUI's available for every platform
Dozens of them, it seems
If anyone has recommendations for Git GUI's, please put them int he chat
Maybe we can get back to that at the end of the presentation

Next, I'm using a flavor of Arch Linux called Manjaro
Which I've added a bunch of stuff to to make my life easier
Namely, Powerline, which integrates with Git
and displays info about the git and command status

On Mac, lots of this is the same
On Windows, well, the git commands are the same at least

Each tutorial will link to the GitHub documentation for the relevant topic
And those docs have you covered

Lastly, there's no shame in looking up every little thing!
Stack Overflow wrote most of this presentation, when you get down to it
When you forget stuff, just look it up, don't get down on yourself about it
It's confusing because it's new and because it's complicated, so

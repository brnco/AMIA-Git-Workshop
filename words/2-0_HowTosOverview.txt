2-0 background for the How To's

Ok everyone, for these tutorials there's a few things you gotta know
I'm exclusively using the command line for Git
I'm doing this for two reasons
1) it's how I use Git and what I'm familiar with
2) I want to make the command line less scary

Because, if you get into this kind of work, you will have to use the command line
It's not so bad

There are Git GUI's available for every platform
Dozens of them, it seems
If anyone has recommendations for Git GUI's, please put them in the chat
Maybe we can get back to that at the end of the presentation

Next, I'm using a flavor of Arch Linux called Manjaro
Which I've added a bunch of stuff to to make my life easier
Namely, Powerline, which integrates with Git
and displays info about the git and command status

On Mac, lots of this is the same
On Windows, well, the git commands are the same at least

Each tutorial will link to the GitHub documentation for the relevant topic
And those docs have you covered

I made 6 tutorials but I think we only have time for 2-3 today
I want to be sure we have plenty of time for questions
But, all 6 tutorials are live now, and you can watch them whenever
Bookmark this presentation and come back
There's also no shortage of help on YouTube and Stack Overflow
so, I just wanted to maximize our discussion time

This first video is about contributing to open source without using Git
And I left off 1 very important mechanism for doing that: DONATE
It takes a lot of labor to do open source projects
They form the backbone of so much, we wouldn't have the web without them
If you or your organization use a project a lot
Consider giving back to it, with money
That's 1 easy way to support open source and it's not very technical

Ok on to the show
